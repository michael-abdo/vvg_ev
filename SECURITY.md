### 📧 Private Reporting

**Do NOT create a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please email security concerns to: **[security-contact-email]**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)

### ⏱️ Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Varies by complexity and severity

### 🏆 Recognition

We appreciate security researchers and will acknowledge your contribution (with your permission) in:
- Security advisories
- Release notes
- Hall of fame (if applicable)

## 🛡️ Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Azure AD Integration**: Enterprise-grade authentication
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure session management with automatic expiry
- **Role-Based Access**: User permissions and document ownership
- **CSRF Protection**: Built-in Next.js CSRF protection

### Data Protection

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage
- **XSS Protection**: Content Security Policy and input escaping
- **File Upload Security**: MIME type validation and size limits

### Infrastructure Security

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All production traffic encrypted
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers via NGINX
- **Environment Isolation**: Separate staging and production environments
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables for sensitive data

### Database Security

- **Connection Encryption**: SSL/TLS for database connections
- **Access Controls**: Limited database user permissions
- **Data Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted at rest
- **Backup Security**: Encrypted database backups

### File Storage Security

- **S3 Bucket Policies**: Restricted access with IAM roles
- **Pre-signed URLs**: Temporary, secure file access
- **File Validation**: Content type and malware scanning
- **Access Logging**: All file operations are logged

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Required Security Settings

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Strong secret for JWT signing
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-strong-secret-here

# Secure database connection
DATABASE_SSL=true
DATABASE_SSL_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=true

# S3 security
S3_BUCKET_ENCRYPTION=true
S3_ACCESS_LOGGING=true
```

#### NGINX Security Headers
```nginx
# Security headers (included in deployment config)
add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'..." always;
```

### Development Security

- **`.env.local`**: Never commit secrets to version control
- **Debug Mode**: Disable in production (`NODE_ENV=production`)
- **Error Logging**: Sanitize sensitive data in logs
- **Development Endpoints**: Disabled in production

## ⚠️ Known Security Considerations

### File Upload Risks

- **File Type Validation**: Only PDF, DOCX, TXT files allowed
- **Size Limits**: 10MB maximum file size
- **Content Scanning**: Basic MIME type verification
- **Storage Isolation**: Files stored with unique identifiers

### Third-Party Dependencies

- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated monthly
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automated scanning with npm audit
- **License Compliance**: All dependencies reviewed for licensing

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints have rate limits
- **Authentication Required**: All document operations require auth
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation
- **Error Handling**: No sensitive data in error responses
