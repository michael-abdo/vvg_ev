# CHANGELOG

All notable changes to the NDA Analyzer documentation are documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-03

### Documentation Consolidation

#### Removed Duplicates
- **Database Schema** - Removed duplicate schema definitions from 5 locations:
  - `/claude.md` → Reference to `/app/api/migrate-db/route.ts`
  - `/project.md` → Reference to `/app/api/migrate-db/route.ts`
  - `/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` → Reference to `/app/api/migrate-db/route.ts`
  - `/docs/nda_analyzer_design.md` → Reference to `/app/api/migrate-db/route.ts`
  - **Canonical Source**: `/app/api/migrate-db/route.ts` (actual implementation)

- **Implementation Status** - Consolidated tracking from 5 locations:
  - `/claude.md` → Reference to `/docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`
  - `/project.md` → Reference to `/docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`
  - `/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` → Reference to `/docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`
  - `/docs/nda_analyzer_design.md` → Reference to `/docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`
  - **Canonical Source**: `/docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`

- **Blocker Lists** - Removed duplicates from all docs except:
  - **Canonical Source**: `/docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`

- **MVP Roadmap** - Removed duplicate roadmap from:
  - `/claude.md` → Reference to `/docs/MVP_ROADMAP.md`
  - **Canonical Source**: `/docs/MVP_ROADMAP.md`

- **Environment Configuration** - Simplified in:
  - `/claude.md` → Reference to `.env.local` with key points only

#### Benefits
1. **Single Source of Truth** - Each piece of information now has one authoritative location
2. **Reduced Maintenance** - Updates only need to be made in one place
3. **Clearer Documentation** - Readers know exactly where to find information
4. **Version Control** - Easier to track changes when not duplicated

#### Document Hierarchy Established
1. **Implementation Guide**: `/claude.md` - References other docs
2. **Requirements**: `/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` - Core requirements only
3. **Current Status**: `/docs/DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md` - Live status tracking
4. **Development Plan**: `/docs/MVP_ROADMAP.md` - Phased approach
5. **Schema Source**: `/app/api/migrate-db/route.ts` - Actual code

### Why These Changes Were Made
- Multiple documents contained the same database schema (6 duplicates)
- Implementation status was tracked in 5 different places
- Blockers were listed in 5 locations with slight variations
- This created confusion about which was the authoritative source
- Updates required changing multiple files, increasing error risk

### Verification
All references now point to their canonical sources. No functionality was changed, only documentation organization.
