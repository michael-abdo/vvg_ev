# NDA Analyzer - MVP Development Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a practical, phased approach to developing the NDA Analyzer MVP while working around current blockers. Each phase delivers functional value and can be developed independently.

**Guiding Principle**: Build what we can now, prepare for what's blocked, deliver value incrementally.

---

## Phase 0: Foundation Fix (Immediate - 1 Day)

### Objective
Fix critical blockers preventing basic functionality.

### Tasks
1. **Update S3 Configuration** ⚡ CRITICAL
   ```bash
   # Update .env.local
   S3_BUCKET_NAME=vvg-cloud-storage
   S3_FOLDER_PREFIX=nda-analyzer/
   ```

2. **Test Upload Flow**
   - Verify file upload to S3 works
   - Confirm file deduplication via hash
   - Check S3 file organization

3. **Document Current State**
   - Create DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md
   - List what works vs what's blocked
   - Document workarounds

### Deliverable
✅ Working file upload to S3 with proper organization

---

## Phase 1: Document Management UI (Days 2-3)

### Objective
Build complete document management interface without database dependency.

### Components to Build

#### 1. Document Library Page (`/app/(dashboard)/documents/page.tsx`)
```typescript
// Mock data from S3 listing while DB is unavailable
interface Document {
  id: string;
  filename: string;
  uploadDate: string;
  size: number;
  status: 'uploaded' | 'processing' | 'processed';
}
```

#### 2. Upload Enhancement
- Add upload progress indicator
- Show recent uploads in session
- File type validation (PDF/DOCX only)
- Size limit enforcement (10MB)

#### 3. Document Actions
- View document details
- Download original file
- Delete from S3
- Mark as "standard NDA" (in session)

### Implementation Strategy
- Use React state for document list
- Store in sessionStorage for persistence
- List S3 files via API endpoint
- No database required initially

### Deliverable
✅ Full document management UI using S3 as storage backend

---

## Phase 2: Text Extraction Integration (Days 4-5)

### Objective
Process uploaded documents to extract text without storing in database.

### Tasks

1. **Integrate Tesseract.js**
   ```bash
   npm install tesseract.js pdf-parse mammoth
   ```

2. **Create Processing Pipeline**
   - PDF → pdf-parse → text
   - DOCX → mammoth → text  
   - Store extracted text in S3 alongside document

3. **Update Upload Flow**
   - After S3 upload, trigger extraction
   - Show processing status
   - Display extracted text preview

4. **S3 Structure**
   ```
   vvg-cloud-storage/
   └── nda-analyzer/
       └── users/
           └── [user-email]/
               └── documents/
                   └── [file-hash]/
                       ├── original.pdf
                       └── extracted.json
   ```

### Deliverable
✅ Automatic text extraction with results stored in S3

---

## Phase 3: Mock Comparison System (Days 6-7)

### Objective
Build complete comparison UI with mock AI responses.

### Components

1. **Comparison Setup Page**
   - Select standard NDA
   - Select document to compare
   - Initiate comparison

2. **Comparison Engine (Mock)**
   ```typescript
   // Return realistic mock data
   interface ComparisonResult {
     overallScore: number;
     sections: Section[];
     suggestions: Suggestion[];
     risks: Risk[];
   }
   ```

3. **Results Display**
   - Side-by-side document view
   - Highlighted differences
   - AI suggestions panel
   - Risk assessment

4. **Results Storage**
   - Save comparison JSON to S3
   - Retrieve previous comparisons
   - No database required

### Deliverable
✅ Complete comparison workflow with realistic mock data

---

## Phase 4: Database Integration (When Permissions Granted)

### Objective
Migrate from S3-only to proper database storage.

### Migration Tasks

1. **Run Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Execute /app/api/migrate-db/route.ts
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/migrate-db
   ```

2. **Backfill Data from S3**
   - Scan S3 for existing documents
   - Create database records
   - Maintain S3 URLs

3. **Update APIs**
   - Switch from S3 listing to DB queries
   - Improve performance with indexes
   - Add proper pagination

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Verify all S3 files have DB records
   - Clean up orphaned files
   - Set up foreign key constraints

### Deliverable
✅ Full database-backed document management

---

## Phase 5: Real AI Integration (When API Key Provided)

### Objective
Replace mock comparisons with real OpenAI analysis.

### Implementation

1. **OpenAI Integration**
   ```typescript
   // lib/nda/openai.ts
   async function compareNDAs(
     standard: string,
     thirdParty: string
   ): Promise<ComparisonResult>
   ```

2. **Prompt Engineering**
   - Design comparison prompts
   - Extract key differences
   - Generate actionable suggestions
   - Identify risk areas

3. **Cost Optimization**
   - Cache OpenAI responses
   - Implement token limits
   - Use GPT-4 selectively
   - Batch similar requests

### Deliverable
✅ Real AI-powered NDA analysis

---

## Phase 6: Export & Polish (Days 8-10)

### Objective
Add export functionality and polish UX.

### Features

1. **Export Formats**
   - PDF export with formatting
   - DOCX with track changes
   - Executive summary option

2. **UI Polish**
   - Loading animations
   - Error boundaries
   - Empty states
   - Success notifications

3. **Performance**
   - Implement caching
   - Optimize API calls
   - Lazy load components
   - Image optimization

### Deliverable
✅ Production-ready MVP with export functionality

---

## Phase 7: Production Deployment (When EC2 Ready)

### Objective
Deploy to production environment.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Configure production .env
   - Set up SSL certificates
   - Configure NGINX proxy
   - Set up PM2 process

2. **Database Migration**
   - Run migrations on production
   - Set up backups
   - Configure monitoring

3. **Testing**
   - End-to-end testing
   - Load testing
   - Security audit
   - Performance benchmarks

### Deliverable
✅ Live production application at legal.vtc.systems/nda-analyzer

---

## Development Guidelines

### Daily Workflow
1. Check blockers status
2. Work on current phase
3. Test thoroughly
4. Document progress
5. Prepare for next phase

### Code Patterns
```typescript
// Always handle loading/error states
const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);
const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);

// Use existing UI components
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Card } from "@/components/ui/card";

// Follow existing patterns
const response = await fetch('/api/upload', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});
```

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing for MVP
- Document test cases
- Create Postman collection
- Plan for automated tests post-MVP

---

## Timeline Summary

### Week 1 (Can Do Now)
- Day 1: Fix S3, test uploads
- Days 2-3: Document management UI
- Days 4-5: Text extraction

### Week 2 (Mostly Independent)
- Days 6-7: Mock comparison system
- Days 8-10: Export & polish

### When Unblocked
- Database integration (1-2 days)
- Real AI integration (2-3 days)
- Production deployment (2-3 days)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### If S3 Access Fails
- Use local filesystem temporarily
- Switch to alternative S3 bucket
- Request new AWS credentials

### If Database Never Accessible
- Continue with S3-only approach
- Use DynamoDB alternative
- Implement file-based storage

### If OpenAI Unavailable
- Ship with mock comparisons
- Integrate alternative AI (Claude API, etc.)
- Build rule-based comparison

---

## Success Metrics

### MVP Success = 
✅ Users can upload NDAs  
✅ System extracts text  
✅ Comparison shows differences  
✅ Results are exportable  
✅ All behind secure auth  

### Stretch Goals
- 95% text extraction accuracy
- < 2 minute processing time
- Professional export quality
- Zero security vulnerabilities

---

**Remember**: Perfect is the enemy of good. Ship incremental value while working around blockers.

**Next Action**: Update .env.local with `S3_BUCKET_NAME=vvg-cloud-storage` and test upload flow.
