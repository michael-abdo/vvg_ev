# NDA Analyzer - Live Status Dashboard

**Last Updated**: 2025-07-04 | **Gap Analysis Completed** | **Production Readiness: NO-GO** 🛑

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Production Readiness Summary

**Infrastructure: 90% Ready** ✅ | **Business Logic: 10% Ready** ❌

The application has **excellent infrastructure** but **lacks core business functionality**:
- ✅ Can upload and store NDAs
- ❌ **CANNOT analyze NDAs** (AI integration not implemented)
- ❌ **CANNOT export results** (Export system not built)
- ❌ **CANNOT track comparison history** (APIs missing)

**Time to Production: 2-3 days of focused development required**

## 🚦 Component Status

| Component | Status | Reality Check | Test Command |
|-----------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Auth | ✅ 100% Working | Full Azure AD integration | `curl http://localhost:3000/api/auth/session` |
| Database | 🟡 95% Connected | Schema mismatch issues | `curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-db` |
| Storage | ✅ 100% Working | S3 + local fallback | `/api/storage-health` |
| **OpenAI** | ❌ 0% Implemented | **API key set but NO CODE** | Compare returns mock data |
| Text Extraction | ❌ 0% Integrated | Libraries installed, not used | Not integrated in upload |
| Export System | ❌ 0% Built | Libraries installed, no API | `/api/export` doesn't exist |
| EC2 | ❌ Cannot access | No SSH/SSM permissions | Instance: i-035db647b0a1eb2e7 |

## 🔴 Critical Missing Features (BUSINESS LOGIC)

### 1. **AI Comparison - CORE FEATURE MISSING**
- **Severity**: CRITICAL 🔴
- **Impact**: App cannot fulfill its primary purpose
- **Location**: `/app/api/compare/route.ts` returns mock data
- **Fix Required**: 
  ```typescript
  // Need to implement:
  - Initialize OpenAI client
  - Extract text from documents
  - Send to GPT-4 for analysis
  - Store real results
  ```

### 2. **Text Extraction Not Integrated**
- **Severity**: HIGH 🟠
- **Impact**: Documents uploaded but text never extracted
- **Location**: Upload flow missing extraction step
- **Fix Required**: Add extraction after storage in upload API

### 3. **Missing API Endpoints**
- **Severity**: HIGH 🟠
- **APIs Not Implemented**:
  - `GET /api/comparisons` - List comparison history
  - `POST /api/export` - Generate PDF/DOCX reports

### 4. **Database Schema Mismatches**
- **Severity**: MEDIUM 🟡
- **Issue**: Migration uses different column names than code expects
- **Example**: Schema has `document1_id`, code expects `standard_doc_id`

## 🔥 Active Blockers

### Infrastructure Blockers (Can Work Around)
1. **EC2 Access** - Cannot SSH/SSM to i-035db647b0a1eb2e7 → Contact AWS Admin
2. **DB Tables** - Cannot CREATE → Using in-memory fallback ✅
3. **S3 Permissions** - For production → Using local storage fallback ✅

### Development Blockers (MUST FIX)
1. **No AI Implementation** - Core feature completely missing
2. **No Export System** - Cannot generate reports
3. **Schema Mismatches** - Will cause runtime errors with real DB

## ✅ What's Actually Working

### Infrastructure (90% Complete)
- ✅ Full authentication system with Azure AD
- ✅ Document upload with deduplication
- ✅ Storage abstraction (S3/local)
- ✅ Database abstraction (MySQL/memory)
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Deployment configurations ready
- ✅ Development workflows (`npm run dev:clean`, `npm run dev:seed`)

### Missing Business Logic (10% Complete)
- ❌ AI-powered NDA comparison
- ❌ Text extraction from documents
- ❌ Export/report generation
- ❌ Comparison history tracking

## 📊 Realistic Development Timeline

| Phase | Task | Status | Actual Time Needed |
|-------|------|--------|-------------------|
| 1 | Fix Schema Mismatches | 🔴 Required | 30 minutes |
| 2 | Implement OpenAI Integration | 🔴 Required | 2-4 hours |
| 3 | Add Text Extraction | 🔴 Required | 1-2 hours |
| 4 | Build Missing APIs | 🔴 Required | 2-3 hours |
| 5 | Create Export System | 🔴 Required | 2-3 hours |
| **TOTAL** | **To Production** | **🔴** | **2-3 days** |

## 🎯 Path to Production

### Day 1: Core AI Features
```bash
Morning:
- Fix database schema mismatches (30 min)
- Implement OpenAI client initialization (1 hour)
- Build real comparison logic (2-3 hours)

Afternoon:
- Integrate text extraction in upload flow (1-2 hours)
- Test AI comparison end-to-end (1 hour)
```

### Day 2: Missing APIs & Export
```bash
Morning:
- Implement GET /api/comparisons (1-2 hours)
- Implement POST /api/export (2-3 hours)

Afternoon:
- Test export functionality (1 hour)
- Integration testing (1-2 hours)
```

### Day 3: Production Prep
```bash
- Performance testing
- Security review
- Documentation update
- Deployment verification
```

## 🔧 Test Documents Available

- 3 VVG standard NDAs in `/documents/vvg/`
- 7 third-party sample NDAs in `/documents/third-party/`
- Total: 10 test documents ready for development

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix database schema mismatches
2. **Priority 1**: Implement OpenAI integration (without this, app is just a file uploader)
3. **Priority 2**: Complete missing APIs
4. **Priority 3**: Deploy once core features work

## ⚠️ Developer Warning

**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until:
- [ ] OpenAI integration is implemented and tested
- [ ] Export system is built
- [ ] Database schema mismatches are resolved
- [ ] All documented APIs are implemented
